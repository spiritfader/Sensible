figure out expected window dimensions for each item to sense (main problem is width - need to know how wide we can go based on terminal size)
set up box window for each sensor category, divide window into two columns: name and value for each sensor
set up window below with commands, await user input between refreshes
arrow keys scroll through sensor columns

d /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/name
l /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_value
v /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input
